1) The compiler defaults normally to STRICT ANSI  unless implicitely specified. Hence it is required to specify BSD_SOURCE which has been deprecated and now it is known as default source. This allows the features.h (implicitely included by unistd.h) to not default __STRICT_ANSI__

2) qsub is a command which submits the program to the portable batch system which schedules, which allocates computational tasks based on the resource availability.

3) -q destination -l resource_list -N name 

node =  unit with processors
ppn = processor per node
for example 4 cores 4 processors per node, is 16 processes


4) Use -lm to compile the files.
